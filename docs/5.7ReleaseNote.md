# 5.7 Overview
:::info
    Copied from Crytek official Website
:::

This CRYENGINE 5.7 Long Term Support (LTS) release is aimed at improving the workflows of the Engine with the latest development software.

Besides fixing several bugs reported both internally and by the community, it also features updates such as the GamePlatform Plugin (with Flow Graph and Schematyc nodes added for your convenience), as well Scaleform 4 support.

## Highlights

### Scaleform 4
An improvement over Scaleform 3, the Scaleform 4 integration features customized rendering for higher performance on all platforms. 

It is backwards compatible with ActionScript 2.0, providing you with the performance benefits of Scaleform 4 without having to remake your Flash projects in ActionScript 3.0, while also supporting ActionScript 3.0 which in turn allows the use of Adobe Animate. Scaleform 3 however is still available, in case the upgrade to Scaleform 4 causes unforeseen bugs to block your projects.

### Scaleform Schematyc
The Scaleform Schematyc plugin has been provided to emulate the necessary functions that are provided by Flow Graph for the UI system.  UI elements are available as Components, while functions and events corresponding to these elements can be defined in an Element XML file.

It supports both Scaleform 3 and 4.

### GamePlatform Plugin
The GamePlatform plugin is an update to the plugin that was shipped with CRYENGINE 5.6.

Expanded features include support for various platforms such as Steam, PlayStation and Xbox. Additionally, it includes an optional new plugin which provides visual scripting nodes for Flow Graph and Schematyc. The deprecated Discord Rich Presence SDK has also been updated to the Discord Game SDK.

### Visual Studio 2017 - 2022 Support
Engine code and CMake has been updated to support Visual Studio versions 2017, 2019 and 2022, while Visual Studio 2015 support has been deprecated.

Along with this upgrade, support for the C++17 standard implementation has been added while Windows SDK has been updated to 10.0.20348.0.

## Release Notes

#### Animation General
 - New: Added optional environmental wind to vCloth.
